# barebones.js
Barebones.js is a really cool little bookmarklet that will strip just about any website to bare essentials in one click of a bookmark. It doesn't require anything but a swift press and about 20ms of time to butcher a website from everything to the nude.

## Bugs
As you can probably imagine, a little bookmarklet that runs almost instantly isn't entirely bug free. In fact, here is The New York Times before:

I've found that Barebones.js works really well or really badly. There is no in between. It is easy to read blogs with, it is easy to read StackOverflow and GitHub with, and its just pretty useful to have.
